# hmmm how did you get here?

anyway- if you found this, you are smart (or just understands how github works)

you get each scratch ID in index.html on any line like `"<button onclick="selectLevel(number)">Level 1</button>"`

the number is the scratch ID so it would be like "https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/number/"

DONT STEAL IT AND REPUBLISH IT OR I WILL COME FOR YOU
